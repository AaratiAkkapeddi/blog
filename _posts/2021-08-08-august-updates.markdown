Dear readers,<br><br>
I’m back from being on the road and writing to update you on both professional and personal news.

Let’s start with professional:
1. [Meg Miller](https://megmiller.world/) wrote [a piece for the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/07/26/arts/design/mom-deepfake-akkapeddi.html) about my project I knew that if I walked in your footsteps, it would become a ritual (completed as part of my residency with [Ada X](https://www.ada-x.org/en/)). Dann and I were stuck with a broken AC in the middle of heatwave in Nebraska when I was surprised with a couple text messages about how the article was actually featured as an editor’s pick at some point (screenshot proof below)! A big thank you to Meg Miller for interviewing myself and my mother for this piece :) (and a thank you to my mom for participating in both the interview and in my video piece!)<br><br>

2. This semester I will be part of the cohort at the ITP/IMA project residency at NYU where my faculty point person will be Allison Parrish. I am so grateful for this opportunity and look forward to writing updates as the semester progresses. I’m also a huge fan of Allison Parrish’s work and have found myself drawn to [this particular article](https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/art-and-ideas/the-umbra-of-an-imago-writing-under-control-of-machine-learning/) of hers while thinking about my relationship to machine learning.

As for personal updates, I basically just have a lot of road trip pictures to share. It’s in moments like these I actually find myself really missing social media. I miss sending indirect updates to and getting indirect updates from my friends. But I made my choice and I will stick to it! Instead, I’ll just use this newsletter to show off pics of Dann and Papaya in various places :)

So our actual itinerary ended up like this:
